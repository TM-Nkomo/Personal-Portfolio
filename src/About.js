              <h2> About Me</h2>
              <br/> <br/>
              <p>My love for computers began at a young age, sparked by my curiosity to understand how these machines worked and the 
                endless possibilities they offered. This passion led me to pursue a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at the 
                University of Witwatersrand, where I delved into the intricate world of software engineering and machine learning. </p>
                
              <p> Upon graduation, I embarked on a professional journey as a Junior Software Developer at a dynamic company in Johannesburg, 
                specializing in Business Intelligence. Here, I have had the opportunity to apply my skills in Java, JavaScript, HTML, 
                CSS, and React, working collaboratively with teams to deliver innovative solutions. My role has exposed me to various tools and methodologies, including GitHub for version control and Jira for project 
                management, enhancing my understanding of software development lifecycles. Additionally, working with Backendless has 
                deepened my knowledge of backend technologies and data management. </p>
                
              <p> Driven by a thirst for knowledge, I am constantly seeking to expand my skill set and stay abreast of emerging 
                technologies and trends in the ever-evolving field of computer science. In my spare time, I channel my creativity 
                into side projects, where I can experiment with new concepts and technologies, fueling my desire for growth and 
                innovation. Outside of the professional realm, I indulge in hobbies such as playing chess, which not only sharpens my strategic 
                thinking but also teaches me the importance of foresight and planning. I also find solace in running, embracing the 
                challenge it presents and relishing the opportunity to push my physical boundaries. </p>
                
              <p> Ultimately, my aspiration is to make a meaningful impact in the field of computer science, leveraging my skills and 
                experiences to contribute to advancements that shape the future. With dedication, perseverance, and a relentless 
                pursuit of excellence, I am determined to carve a path that leaves a lasting legacy in the world of technology.
